Dead Rabbit Society Project Manager README
------------------------------------------

### Introduction

This app is intended to be a project task manager for Dead Rabbit Society campaigns. The tasks are available as a JSON API. 

#### Screen Shots

#### Wireframes


#### User Story

As a user, I want the ability to add directives for the current DRS mission, order tasks by priority, and delete tasks once they have been completed. 

#### General Approach

My general approach to this task was to create the basic list functionality first, and then fiddle with Materialize to make everything pretty. 

#### Hurdles & Unsolved Problems
**Hurdles:** Getting the list items to delete was difficult, as was ordering the list. 

**Unsolved Problems:** My next step is to add user auth. 

#### Technologies Used

- NodeJS
- Express
- MongodB
- Mongoose
